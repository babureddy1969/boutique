# Simple Boutique Application

This Android application displays the list of customers. The list can be sorted by balance or transaction date.
This data is stored in local SQLite DB. The sorting and clear actions are performed by direct SQLite DB queries.

Customer sale data can be entered in a screen. Caluculations are performed as the data is entered for every key stroke.
